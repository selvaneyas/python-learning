    "Decision Trees, a powerful and intuitive algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŒ³ What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each internal node represents a decision on a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each branch represents an outcome of that decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each leaf node represents a final output label (class/number).\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Easy to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Handles numerical & categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Non-linear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’¡ How does it work?\n",
    "- Splits data based on the feature that best separates the classes/values.\n",
    "Uses criteria like:\n",
    "  - Gini Index or Entropy (Information Gain) for classification.\n",
    "  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression.\n",
    "## ðŸ“Š Applications\n",
    "- Classification (e.g., Spam Detection, Loan Approval)\n",
    "- Regression (e.g., House Price Prediction)\n",
    "- Feature Importance Ranking\n"
