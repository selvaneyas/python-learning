    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a powerful clustering algorithm that identifies dense regions in data and separates them from noise (outliers). Unlike k-Means, it does not require predefining the number of clusters and can detect clusters of arbitrary shapes.\n",
