## 🔍 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐃𝐨 𝐖𝐞 𝐒𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚?

 ✅ Avoid Overfitting – Helps the model generalize to new data.

 ✅ Model Evaluation – Measures performance on unseen data before deployment.

 ✅ Better Decision-Making – Ensures the model isn't biased toward specific data patterns.



## 🛠 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧-𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐒𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭 (𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝)

The dataset is divided into two parts:

 📌 Training Set (80%) – Used to train the model.

 📌 Test Set (20%) – Used to evaluate model performance.

 🔹 random_state=42 ensures reproducibility.

 🔹 test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data is used for testing.



## 🛠 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬-𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: 𝐀 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡

Instead of a single train-test split, cross-validation divides the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets and evaluating on the remaining fold. This reduces bias and variance.



### 🔄 𝑲-𝑭𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝑪𝒓𝒐𝒔𝒔-𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏

K-Fold CV splits the dataset into K equal parts (e.g., 5 or 10).

The model is trained K times, with a different fold used for testing each time.



The final performance is the average of all K evaluations.

 🔹 KFold(n_splits=5): Splits the data into 5 folds.

 🔹 shuffle=True: Randomizes the data before splitting.



## 🚀𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲 & 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬

 ✅ Train-test split is essential for model evaluation.

 ✅ Cross-validation improves reliability by testing on multiple subsets.

Feature scaling is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning. Many algorithms perform better when numerical features are on the same scale. Today, we’ll explore Normalization and Standardization—two widely used techniques.



## 🔍 Why Feature Scaling?

     ✅ Improves Model Performance – Some ML algorithms are sensitive to scale differences.

     ✅ Speeds Up Training – Gradient descent converges faster when features are scaled.

     ✅ Enhances Comparability – Keeps all features on a similar range.



## 📌 Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)

Normalization (also called Min-Max Scaling) transforms features to a fixed range, typically [0,1] or [-1,1].



      ✅ Best for neural networks and distance-based models (e.g., KNN, K-Means).

🔹 Transforms values between 0 and 1.

🔹 Sensitive to outliers (can distort scaling).



## 📌 Standardization (Z-Score Scaling)

Standardization (also called Z-score normalization) transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance.



     ✅ Best for algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA, and Linear Regression.

🔹 Works well for normally distributed data.

🔹 Less sensitive to outliers than Min-Max Scaling.



## 🚀 When to Use Which?

🔹 Use Normalization if the data follows a non-Gaussian distribution and models like KNN, K-Means, Neural Networks.

🔹 Use Standardization if the data is normally distributed or required by algorithms like SVM, Linear Regression, or PCA.



## 📌 Summary & Key Takeaways

✅ Scaling is crucial for optimal model performance.

✅ Normalization (Min-Max) scales data between [0,1].

✅ Standardization (Z-score) ensures zero mean and unit variance.

✅ Different algorithms prefer different scaling techniques.

 ✅ To model complex curves and trends in the data.


## 📊 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬

 ⚙️ Polynomial Regression captures non-linear patterns effectively.

 ⚙️ Degree selection is crucial — too low: underfitting, too high: overfitting.

 ⚙️ Always compare with Linear Regression to assess improvement.

 ⚙️ Check R² Score (closer to 1 is better) and MSE (lower is better) to evaluate fit.



 ✅ Polynomial Regression is essential for curved patterns where linear models fail.
