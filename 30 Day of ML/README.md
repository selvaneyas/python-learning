# 📌 Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning  
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  

## 🔹 What You’ll Learn Today:  
✅ What is Machine Learning?  
✅ Types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)  
✅ Real-world applications  
✅ Setting up Python environment  
✅ Writing your first ML script  

Run the following command to install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```



# 📌 Day 2: Essential Python Libraries for ML  

Today, we explored the key Python libraries for Machine Learning:  

## 🔹 Libraries Covered  
✅ **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
✅ **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
✅ **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
✅ **Scikit-Learn** – ML model training  




# 📌 Day 3: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning in ML  

## 🔹 Why is Data Preprocessing Important?  
Raw data can be messy, so we need to clean and transform it before using it in ML models.  

## 🔹 Key Steps Covered  
✅ Handling Missing Data  
✅ Removing Duplicates  
✅ Feature Scaling (Standardization, Min-Max Scaling)  
✅ Encoding Categorical Data  



# 📌 Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

## 🔹 Why is EDA Important?  
EDA helps us understand patterns in data before applying ML models.  

## 🔹 Key EDA Techniques Covered  
✅ Summary Statistics (`describe()`, `info()`)  
✅ Handling Missing Values (`isnull()`, `fillna()`)  
✅ Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Correlation Heatmaps)  



# 📌 Day 5: Feature Engineering in Machine Learning  

## 🔹 Why is Feature Engineering Important?  
Feature Engineering transforms raw data into meaningful inputs for ML models.  

## 🔹 Key Techniques Covered  
✅ Handling Missing Values (`SimpleImputer`)  
✅ Encoding Categorical Variables (`OneHotEncoder`)  
✅ Scaling & Normalization (`StandardScaler`)  
✅ Feature Selection (`SelectKBest`)  
✅ Creating New Features (`pd.cut()`)  


# 📌 Day 6: Handling Outliers in Machine Learning (Python)

Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the dataset. They can distort machine learning models, reducing accuracy. Detecting and handling them properly improves model performance.

## 📊 **Why Handle Outliers?**
✅ Prevents biased model training  
✅ Enhances data reliability  
✅ Improves prediction accuracy  

## 🔍 **Methods for Outlier Detection and Handling**

### 1️⃣ **Visualization Techniques**
- **Box Plot**: Helps visualize data distribution  
- **Histogram**: Identifies skewness in data  
- **Scatter Plot**: Detects anomalies  

### 2️⃣ **Statistical Methods**
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** Removes values outside **1.5 times the IQR**  
- **Z-Score:** Filters values with **z-score greater than 3**  

### 3️⃣ **Machine Learning Methods**
- **Isolation Forest**  
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)**
