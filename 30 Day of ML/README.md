# 📌 Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning  
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  

## 🔹 What You’ll Learn Today:  
✅ What is Machine Learning?  
✅ Types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)  
✅ Real-world applications  
✅ Setting up Python environment  
✅ Writing your first ML script  

Run the following command to install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```



# 📌 Day 2: Essential Python Libraries for ML  

Today, we explored the key Python libraries for Machine Learning:  

## 🔹 Libraries Covered  
✅ **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
✅ **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
✅ **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
✅ **Scikit-Learn** – ML model training  




# 📌 Day 3: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning in ML  

## 🔹 Why is Data Preprocessing Important?  
Raw data can be messy, so we need to clean and transform it before using it in ML models.  

## 🔹 Key Steps Covered  
✅ Handling Missing Data  
✅ Removing Duplicates  
✅ Feature Scaling (Standardization, Min-Max Scaling)  
✅ Encoding Categorical Data
