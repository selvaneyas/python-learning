# ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning  
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  

## ðŸ”¹ What Youâ€™ll Learn Today:  
âœ… What is Machine Learning?  
âœ… Types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)  
âœ… Real-world applications  
âœ… Setting up Python environment  
âœ… Writing your first ML script  

Run the following command to install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
